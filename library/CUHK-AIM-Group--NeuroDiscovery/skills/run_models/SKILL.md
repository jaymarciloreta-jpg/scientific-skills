# Run Models Skill (Model Entry Layer)

## Overview
`run_models` is the NeuroClaw entry skill for model-level inference workflows.

This skill is responsible for:
- Maintaining a model registry (name, paper, source code, input/output, doc file path)
- Selecting the correct model skill under `skills/<model-name>/SKILL.md`
- Coordinating required data preparation before model execution
- Delegating modality preprocessing to `fmri-skill` and `smri-skill`

It supports both:
- deep learning model routes for phenotype prediction
- non-deep-learning statistical / unsupervised / classical machine-learning routes such as first-level and second-level task-fMRI GLM, resting-state ICA, resting-state DictLearning, disease classification with SVM, disease classification with SpaceNet, brain parcellation with K-means, brain parcellation with Hierarchical clustering, temporal filtering, and detrending

This skill does not hardcode detailed install/run commands for each model. Those details are stored in model-specific markdown files.

**Research use only.**

## Requested outputs beyond prediction

When the user asks for clinical research outputs, record them before execution
and check their presence after training. Predictions/accuracy alone do not
satisfy a request for patient subtypes, attribution maps or attention weights.

- `ctp-skill`: 4D CT perfusion preparation or supplied Tmax/CBF/CBV/MTT maps.
- `subject-subtyping`: frozen patient assignments, profiles, group sizes,
  embeddings and descriptive reporting; stability only from real replicate runs.
- `model-interpretability`: target-specific IG/Grad-CAM or actual model attention,
  with subject identity, feature/spatial mapping and numerical QA.

Use each skill's manifest validator with all requested roles. Missing metadata,
unsupported model adapters or failed QA must be reported as incomplete outputs.
Do not retrain a frozen model or launch an additional study just to fill a report.

---

## Core Workflow (Never Bypassed)
1. Identify requested model and task (classification/regression phenotype prediction).
2. Locate the corresponding model skill under `skills/<model-name>/SKILL.md`.
3. Verify required inputs (ROI features, optional sMRI features).
4. If inputs are not ready, delegate preprocessing to modality skills:
	 - `fmri-skill` for ROI extraction from fMRI
	 - `smri-skill` when model additionally requires structural features
5. Generate a numbered execution plan and wait for explicit user confirmation (`YES` / `execute` / `proceed`).
6. On confirmation, execute via `claw-shell` following model doc instructions.

## Scientific Workflow Registry

Workflows define a scientific experiment and delegate model fitting to one or
more canonical model skills. They do not own duplicate model implementations.

| Workflow | Delegated models/tools | Output | Workflow Doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| Neuroimaging Decoding | GLM, Statistical ML, Nilearn SearchLight | predictions, ROI statistics, score maps | `skills/neuroimaging-decoding/SKILL.md` |
| Connectome Discovery | CPM or graph models, map similarity, brain visualization | significant network maps and ranked targets | `skills/connectome-discovery/SKILL.md` |
| Brain-Age Modeling | Statistical ML or CNN3D plus fold-local correction | predicted age and Brain-PAD | `skills/brain-age-modeling/SKILL.md` |

### Cross-Cutting Tools (Apply Across Models)
These are not models. They are horizontal layers that any model in the registry above can opt into without changing model code.

| Tool | Purpose | When to invoke | Tool Doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| harmonization-tool | Remove site/scanner/batch effects from features before model training; supports ComBat / ComBat-GAM / CovBat / site-as-covariate; ships site-stratified and leave-site-out splitters; required for honest mega-analysis across multi-site cohorts | Any multi-site or multi-dataset run (ABIDE, ADHD-200, ABCD, multi-cohort pooling); user mentions ComBat / harmonize / site effect / cross-site / mega-analysis | `skills/harmonization-tool/SKILL.md` |

Insertion point: between dataset-skill output (feature matrix + meta) and model-skill input. Models read harmonized features identically to raw features.

## Harness-Aware Model Registration (Declarative + Testing + Drift Detection)

### Model Specification Format (Extended)
Every model integrated into run_models **must** include a **model specification file** in JSON format alongside its Markdown documentation:

**File**: `skills/{model_name}/{model_name}_spec.json`

```json
{
  "model_name": "brain_gnn",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "paper": "Li et al., 2020",
  "code_repo": "https://github.com/xxlya/BrainGNN_Pytorch",
  "required_dependencies": {
    "torch": ">=1.9.0,<2.1.0",
    "numpy": ">=1.21.0",
    "scipy": ">=1.7.0",
    "networkx": ">=2.6.0"
  },
  "input_spec": {
    "modality": "fMRI",
    "format": "ROI time-series (N_nodes, T_timepoints)",
    "expected_shape": [116, null],
    "value_range": [-5.0, 5.0],
    "required_preprocessing": ["z-score normalization"]
  },
  "output_spec": {
    "type": "classification|regression",
    "classes": null,
    "value_range": null
  },
  "validation_checksums": {
    "weights_sha256": "abc123...",
    "test_data_sha256": "def456..."
  }
}
```

### Test Suite Requirements
Every model **must** include an automated test suite covering:

1. **Input validation**: verify input dimensions, data types, value ranges
2. **Determinism check**: seed control + verify identical outputs with same seed (tolerance: 1e-6)
3. **Performance regression**: compare inference speed and memory usage against baseline
4. **Output coherence**: verify outputs lie within expected value range, no NaN/Inf values
5. **Backward compatibility**: test model against previous version checksum (if available)

**Test execution**:
```bash
python -m pytest run_models/tests/test_{model_name}.py -v --harness-report
```

Output: `run_models_test_report_{model_name}_{timestamp}.json` with pass/fail status and metrics

### Drift Detection Protocol
Monitor production/inference results for concept drift (distribution shift in data or model behavior):

**Automated monitoring per 100 inferences**:
- **Input distribution shift** (KL divergence against reference data): flag if deviation > 0.1
- **Output distribution shift** (prediction probability / regression output quantiles): flag if shift detected
- **Latency drift** (average inference time): alert if >20% increase
- **Failure rate monitoring** (predictions with NaN/Inf / out-of-range): flag if >1% failures

**Logging output**: `run_models_drift_log.json` (append-only, timestamped entries)

Example entry:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-04-05T14:32:00Z",
  "model": "brain_gnn",
  "inference_count": 100,
  "input_kl_divergence": 0.045,
  "output_mean_shift": 0.002,
  "latency_ms": 45.2,
  "failure_rate": 0.0,
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

**Alert thresholds**: 
- KL divergence > 0.1 → generate warning
- Output shift > 5% std dev → investigation recommended
- Latency drift > 20% → check computational resource bottleneck
- Failure rate > 1% → stop inference, require manual review

### Model Card Template (Minimum Required Metadata)
Each model must include a model card in `skills/{model_name}/SKILL.md` documenting:

```markdown
## Model Card: {model_name}

### Model Details
- **Model name**: {name}
- **Version**: {X.Y.Z}
- **Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
- **Source repository**: {repo_url}
- **Paper**: {citation}

### Intended Use
- **Primary use case**: [e.g., fMRI-based phenotype classification]
- **Input modalities**: [fMRI, sMRI, etc.]
- **Supported tasks**: [classification, regression, interpretability]

### Known Limitations
- [e.g., "Trained on N subjects aged 18-65; generalization to pediatric/geriatric populations not validated"]
- [e.g., "Sensitive to head motion artifacts; recommend ICA-FIX preprocessing"]

### Validation Results
- **Test set performance**: [accuracy/AUC/RMSE with confidence intervals]
- **Cross-site validation**: [performance on held-out sites, if applicable]
- **Robustness checks**: [drift detection history, adversarial perturbation results]

### Dependencies & Versioning
- **Required libraries**: [see {model_name}_spec.json]
- **Hash (model weights)**: {SHA256}
- **Last verified**: {date}
```
