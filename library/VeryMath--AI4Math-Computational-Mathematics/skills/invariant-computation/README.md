# Invariant Computation

Chinese guide: [README.zh-CN.md](README.zh-CN.md)

`invariant-computation` helps a coding agent compute, route, and validate algebraic, topological, geometric, TDA, and certified numerical invariants.

## When To Use It

Use this skill when the task involves:

- homology, cohomology, Betti numbers, torsion, Euler characteristic, or persistent homology;
- knot or manifold invariants such as Alexander, Jones, HOMFLY-PT, signatures, determinants, or linking numbers;
- group homology, Hilbert series, Betti tables, primary decomposition, dimension, or degree;
- turning prose, LaTeX, code, triangulations, complexes, filtrations, group presentations, ideals, knot diagrams, or data into a reviewed computational representation.

## What It Produces

The agent should produce representation checkpoints, method/backend routes, command drafts, logs, invariant summaries, validation reports, and explicit caveats about what the computation does not prove.

## Skill Entry Points

The repository root `SKILL.md` is a router. This package contains the concrete
workflow and its references.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `skills/invariant-computation/SKILL.md` | concrete workflow Skill |
| `skills/invariant-computation/agents/openai.yaml` | agent metadata |
| `skills/invariant-computation/manifest.yaml` | package manifest |
| `skills/invariant-computation/references/` | method routes, tool catalog, checks, sources |

## Installation

Copy this to your coding agent:

```text
Please install the `invariant-computation` skill from https://github.com/VeryMath/AI4Math-Computational-Mathematics.git. Read the package `SKILL.md`, install the declared Skill entrypoint, verify that `$invariant-computation` is discoverable, and tell me whether I need to restart the agent.
```

If you already have this skill repository locally, replace the repository URL
with the local folder path. The coding agent should handle cloning, linking,
configuration, reload/restart checks, and verification.

## Quick Start

```text
Use this repository's invariant-computation workflow.

Read:
- repository SKILL.md
- skills/invariant-computation/SKILL.md

Goal:
<describe the mathematical object and invariant you want>

Target:
<local path, equations, triangulation, filtration, group presentation, ideal, knot diagram, dataset, or paper excerpt>

Constraints:
- inspect first;
- build a computation checkpoint before execution;
- ask before dependency changes, long runs, source edits, API calls, or final claims.
```

## How To Interact

The normal interface is a checkpoint loop:

```text
object and requested invariant
  -> representation checkpoint
  -> method and backend route
  -> approve / revise / reject / skip
  -> approved computation or command draft
  -> validation and evidence report
```

Use `approve` to run the proposed next step, `revise` to update the route, `reject` to stop the path, `skip` to move past a phase, and `stop` to end the session and summarize state.

## Example Session

```text
User:
Use this Skill to compute the homology of this simplicial complex.
Do not install packages yet. First inspect and propose the route.

Agent:
I will identify the object representation, coefficient ring, and candidate
backends, then write a computation checkpoint before running anything.

User:
approve the read-only route check.

Agent:
[reports closure checks, candidate tools, expected outputs, and next approval]
```

## Workflow And Outputs

Prefer this evidence layout when durable artifacts are useful:

```text
outputs/<run_id>/
├── input_summary.md
├── representation_checkpoint.md
├── route_plan.md
├── commands/
├── logs/
├── results/invariant_summary.json
├── validation_report.md
└── RUN_SUMMARY.md
```

The JSON summary has a
[versioned schema](schema/invariant_summary.schema.json) and a
[known-answer example](examples/invariant_summary.example.json).
The schema requires either `classification_caveat` or
`classification_theorem_evidence`. Heuristic, partial, and failed results must
also record remaining uncertainty and a next repair route. Every result other
than `failed` must provide a non-null `invariant.value`.

Only create the files that the task needs.

## Safety And Review Rules

- Ask before installing mathematical packages or changing environments.
- Ask before long computations, expensive enumeration, or source edits.
- Record coefficient rings, orientations, grading conventions, variable order, filtration direction, and software versions.
- Prefer exact methods for finite combinatorial or symbolic inputs.
- Use certified or interval-backed routes for numerical geometry when available.
- Do not claim that invariants classify objects unless a cited theorem supports the claim.

## Maintainer Checks

Run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python <path-to-skill-creator>/scripts/quick_validate.py skills/invariant-computation
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Then check that repository docs point back to the package Skill and that no local absolute paths or private tokens were added.
